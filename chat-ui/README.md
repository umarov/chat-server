# Chat UI
This UI is written with [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) and [Material Web Components](https://material.io/components/web)

My goal with this UI is to test the back server. Over time I want to improve the design of it to make it look nicer.

My upcoming things to do for the UI are:

- [ ] Update the web socket payload from the back end to include the content of the message and the user it belongs to.
Right now I store the user first name and last name in the message. I think user details should be displayed separately in the UI

- [ ] Align the messages sent by the current logged in user to the right (similar to most messaging apps) 
- [ ] Turn each message into a "box" of their own. Like chat bubbles?
- [ ] Ability to log off
- [ ] Ability to update user details, including password
- [ ] Add notification support and have user opt in whenever they want to
- [ ] Add chat sounds
- [ ] Render links as links
- [ ] Infinite scroll
- [ ] Support for emoji in messages
- [ ] Ability to react to message with emoji
